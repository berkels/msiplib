Source code conventions
=======================

**Naming conventions:**

* use `lower_case_with_underscores` to name functions
* use `CamelCase` to name classes, starting with a capital letter

**Docstrings:**

* Papers can be cited in docstrings with ``:cite:`label```, where ``label``
  refers to the corresponding reference label in the bibtex file docs/refs.bib.
